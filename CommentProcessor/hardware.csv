one comes without a window (meshify) so it wins imo.
"Right but AMD server market is growing at &gt;50% each quarter for last 6 at least, yet they are still at $100M at best"
"I really dont mind DLSS, if it provided actual fps advantage without all the shimmering noise even with some detail loss it would be good in some games."
Growth in dollars is too
"The AI learns the art style of the game, that's the whole point of using one over a human made algorithm."
"If you think DLSS is primarily for AA, you haven't understood it at all."
it's HUB after all
"I just find it funny that the same people who said that the RT reflections in BFV were too subtle to be noticeable, are the same ones saying that the image quality from DLSS is unacceptable."
"Oooohhhhhhhh, I'm sure they'll get right back to you with every answer your heart desires. Lol"
I can't think it's funny that the super obvious in your face reflections are deemed 'too subtle' and yet people are zooming in and analyzing the pixels of DLSS?
"RTX is an umbrella term that includes raytracing. DLSS requires RTX because it is an RTX feature, but that does not mean that you have to be raytracing in order to enable DLSS."
"It uses standard cherry mx switches, not Wooting's flaretech switches. That means you can swap the switches to whatever you want. "
Why the down votes? Do people really understand how ML works?
But in a discussion about subtlety why does one get a pass and the other doesn't?
"I disagree, I think distant details are improved with DLSS compared to 1800p, and the crawling/moire artifacts are present even at 4K native."
You do realize he mentioned additional techniques other than baking that get around those disadvantages?
The Sony PS2 had this in 2002
Even real RTX impmentations like BFV have been noisy though.
He showed baked (lightmap) ones which are more accurate than voxel ones but obviously not dynamic.
That isn't a good comparison. Noctua fans aren't pretty looking garbage.

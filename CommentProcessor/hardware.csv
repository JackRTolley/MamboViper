one comes without a window meshify so it wins imo
Right but AMD server market is growing at gt each quarter for last  at least yet they are still at M at best
I really dont mind DLSS if it provided actual fps advantage without all the shimmering noise even with some detail loss it would be good in some games
Growth in dollars is too
The AI learns the art style of the game thats the whole point of using one over a human made algorithm
If you think DLSS is primarily for AA you havent understood it at all
its HUB after all
Oooohhhhhhhh Im sure theyll get right back to you with every answer your heart desires Lol
I cant think its funny that the super obvious in your face reflections are deemed too subtle and yet people are zooming in and analyzing the pixels of DLSS
It uses standard cherry mx switches not Wootings flaretech switches That means you can swap the switches to whatever you want 
Why the down votes Do people really understand how ML works
But in a discussion about subtlety why does one get a pass and the other doesnt
I disagree I think distant details are improved with DLSS compared to p and the crawlingmoire artifacts are present even at K native
You do realize he mentioned additional techniques other than baking that get around those disadvantages
The Sony PS had this in 
Noctuas fans are good but overpriced Its like if Apple made fans I dont mind the color tho
He did actually mention others You can also do GI with voxel based techniques which multiple games currently use
Even real RTX impmentations like BFV have been noisy though
He showed baked lightmap ones which are more accurate than voxel ones but obviously not dynamic
That isnt a good comparison Noctua fans arent pretty looking garbage
Im talking about real games shipping software Not tech demosMultiple game use voxelbased GI with multiple dynamic light sources at lower cost than RTX

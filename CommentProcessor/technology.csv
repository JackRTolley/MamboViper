Their main goal is: bash Trump.
"Well if she's on Mac, she's already running a locked down Linux anyway :)"
"sadly, its an incredibly easy thing to do, because Trump provides so much ammunition every day"
"I would basically have no way to communicate with my family. I WANT to quit facebook. So, when the time comes and I can do this, I will, and make another one linked to nothing."
"If facebook implements a tool like this, it will NOT work as advertised.  Know that. They have been lying like republicans in the court of law. Google it."
What does this have to do with technology? Get the crap outta here
Or you know you could just stop using facebook. I haven't been on facebook in 3 years.
"As someone long FB, not good. In fact: Bad. "
"That doesn't really work for an introvert like me. I like checking up on people, but don't particularly want to talk to them :P So for me, Facebook is perfect."
all the tech companies especially Google and Facebook needs to be regulated in a strict manner
But Gab is full of racists anyway so who in their right mind would want to see their comments all over?
Gross. Who wants that?
"Why the negativity towards facebook? What have they ever done to you besides provide a free service to connect to others? People seem to be mad about privacy and data, but facebook needs to keep the lights on somehow. So they take the data that you willingly give them and use it to send you relevant ads. The horror. "
"It's not that advertisements are evil. It's that the general practices of a lot of ad networks, Facebook especially, are."
All advertisement is bad advertisement.
"Just block ads in the browsers and don't watch TV or listen to the radio. It's mindless drivel anyway.  Better to do things with intent, to be in control of what you are exposed to, than to be a sheep following the herd over the edge."
Why is that good? I want to advertise some of my products and campaigns on FB to people that most likely would be interested in. Strange
Another /r/technology post shitting on FB 
Idk if other people have noticed this but when I deleted my Facebook I started getting invited to fewer parties and out of the loop on a lot of events with my friends. My best friends all text me if they're hosting an event but people I speak to once a week or fewer didn't realize they missed someone. Most just go by Facebook and invite based on a previous list. Your name is removed from the previous list if you delete your Facebook. 
"Bingo. Everyone likes to jump on the FACEBOOK BAD REDDIT GOOD bandwagon. The reality is that targeted ads are not all bad, and really not as creepy as everyone makes them out to be."
So cut out the middleman and let me sell my data myself? 
"This!! The hate for FB on Reddit is so palpable! No one gives a shit that you don't use Facebook, 2.6billion people still do so.."
Is browsing the open internet really considered private?
So what's your lawful basis for using a person's data for other than the stated reason it was collected and retained?
"Samsung deserved it, look how it was dressed"
"I know, that's why I asked how is it handled. Surely the grains on the film have some sort of range of light intensity that they can handle or so? How are the handling the calibration of light intensity (so that pure white is at 1000 nits for example)?"
"I know it's a little creepy that they had a microphone that they didn't tell anybody about, but I don't really think its uncommon for companies to list each and every component that a product has, especially  if that component is disabled. I bet there's a bunch of cars out there with microphones that aren't activated because the person buying it didn't opt for that feature. They like to charge high prices for enabling features that are already in the car, without incurring a high cost of producing tons of different models with various options actually included with hardware."
What  service?
Sales?
"Samsung has Facebook as a system app, best you can do is disable it. "
Is this so they can live stream him eating his own dick on every samsung device simultaneously?
You're the product...
They should close their European offices and let the EU make the choice to block traffic.
"Quite a shocking read, pretty much turning my head upside with my present ideas ( thank you for that very informative reading )"
"I fully support this tech, if it can weed out genetic diseases and make us better as humans equaly for all."
Toxic content is the precise content we should protect. Speech isn't free if we only allow approved speech (hello Mao). 
Haha.  No way that ever happens.  
Baby boomers and Republicans are to thank for that. The rest of us recognize that taxes will need to be raised/reallocated to make some changes happen 
So the Legal hate-speech is still OK?
"Live up to the fake news pledge, for starters."
I love that sugar is included as one of the drugs here.
I've had caramelized onions before but none of those other items. It's morning for me and I have a horrible cold. I could maybe have some chicken soup or some porridge right now but that's it.
I would love gene editing.  We could eliminate so many disabilities.  I can see no downside.  
Chinese were empathetically against human torture and a supporter of human rights too sooooooooooooooo
It's also incredibly unethical. 
Define toxic. Define giant. 
"You don't absolutely agree with them, so you're fucking stupid. This is the level of intelligence of that other poster."
Ignore this MAGA idiot. They appear to believe all sorts of bullshit.
Get some moarbrains. Fucking dumb ass antivax motherfucker. Blocked so I don't gotta see your stupid on my good christian reddit anymore.
"Yeah but you can't fix dying unfortunately. Eventually you will get cancer, it's just a matter of time. Even if we could edit the genome in a way that would allow us to live twice as long, you still would eventually get cancer."
Damn. Not even jihadists deserve that.
I agree completely. Deport all antivaxxers
it's how science moves forward
"I am not anti-vax, just anti you. "
"Mandatory infections and quarantine for those who refuse to vaccinate or wilfully spread misinformation and lies? I think so, Seamus. "
They're like the /r/politics or /r/the_donald but for science.
"Capitalism, unfortunately. "
I don't understand...why do these people exist...how did something so ridiculous get so much traction?
Is is too much to hope for the utter collapse of facebook?
"I'm really in love with my Alienware. I'm realizing I didn't *hate PC* I hated the cheap, unreliable ones you get for $400 and then are surprised when they crash. 15 second boot time is fantastic. My mac? Yeah, not even close."
"Of course, they are political opposites. I think he was referring to the single - minded echo chamber that both subs have become. Don't go against the tide unless you want to be heavily downvoted or just banned from the sub. "
BuT mUh CdC sAyS tHiMeRoSaL iS sAfE!!!!!
I was 5 20 years ago...
"Ape is used as a pejorative to describe black people. You are defaming all black people, not to mention actual animals by comparing them to anti vaxxers"
Go and post that on r/The_Donald and you'll see what I mean. :)
I was all mac from 1988 to 2018. Then they abandoned the tower computer.  Did hackintosh for a while but after a point it was just easier to out windows on the machines.   I like windows 10
Flat Earth is just a psyop. Have you ever *met* one? They aren't real.
oh fuck this is against the narrative. DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE 
"Drumpf is a corrupt, racist asshole"
Because the doctors and most science communicators and businesses have accounts on there?
Kinda like how the people saying Jussie Smollett belongs in jail for a fake crime are being attacked?
Educate your people U. S. A.! 
"Ad hominems are a logical fallacy, and have nothing to do with how UK has gone to great lengths to inprison Tommy Robinson for...engaging in freedom of speech, in a peaceful manner, in public."
It should be considered bad when anyone does it if it's that dangerous
"unless your child plans on going to  Pakistan, Afghanistan or Nigeria I think you're safe from contracting Polio. Further more Polio is not a transmittable disease. You can't catch polio from someone. So stay out of those three countries and you'll be fine. Now if you said Measles or something I wouldn't have replied but you're misinformed so I felt the need to correct you. "
Reads like the cringe from /r/politics 
This does not seem well thought out.
"Ironically, this will make it much easier for pedophiles to watch those videos without anyone knowing any better. "

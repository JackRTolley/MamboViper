They should fix the software instead of compensating with bigger batteries

It only affects the name on your local device Bit misleading IMO
Now pls fix the theme override dammit Cant believe it isnt fixed already
I still cant use messages When I write it is shown as SMS instead of RTS We both have Pixel  I dont understand why it doesnt work

"I will leave this reply so you don't feel lonely. Somewhere in the world though, an old English teacher read your post and sighed deeply..."
"Nobody says Chinese phones are bad, people do say that stealing information is (not every chinese company is stealing information I know) "
"The sole purpose of a company existing is to make money, you cannot blame companies for wanting to make money. If you believe that any economic system involving human beings has room for feelings, you need to grow up."
I haven't been impressed by the current folding phones. Hopefully Motorola brings something new to the table and we don't end up with a static market like we have now. 
"This statement, made without a hint of irony, is exactly why people poke fun at this subreddit.  "
Do you want a phone or a laptop my guy?
the furthest thing imaginable? buying up patents for a profit and hurting the industry and the consumer is completely different than patent trolling?
I'm talking about in apps like web browsing. It cuts into the usable space.
"I have no doubt the battery life is good, but it is just disappointing, when compared to their other reviews where it should do better."
"More than the battery life, I wonder why Samsung doesn't equip their latest flagships with a fast Quick Charger"
Using a slur to insult someone is lame as fuck though
"Oh well, there goes my preorder."
FULLY? Think about what you wrote. :P
"Lol what? Not only is the DS probably the best controller ever made, but the steam is probably the worst."
They should fix the software instead of compensating with bigger batteries.
"Ah, I didn't see that."
It only affects the name on your local device. Bit misleading IMO.
"Now pls fix the theme override, dammit. Can't believe it isn't fixed already."
I still can't use messages. When I write it is shown as SMS instead of RTS? We both have Pixel 2. I don't understand why it doesn't work.
"My sister has the Mate 20 Pro. Brilliant phone, with perhaps the only downside being EMUI. Unfortunate as well that Huawei gets a bad rap due to its spying/theft issues, because I think the Mate 20 Pro is a great achievement that shows Chinese brands can create a device that's as good as anything Samsung or Apple can come up with."
"Inferior to the same model in another country. Why would that affect a consumer's decision making? The same thing happens in many other types of electronics... TVs, cars.. Different nations get different variants. People still buy the inferior variant if it remains superior (in their eyes) to all other options within the country. "
"you shouldnt be gifting samsung to anyone unless you dont care about price, specs and want it to look good :)"
"tough? a50 cost in EU more than lg g7 or Pocophone f1, not even worth considering"
And a shitload of advertisements notifications.
I doubt they will allow. Why compete when you can easily cite 'danger to national security'  to keep them out of the country.
It will be a plastic film protector that has the feel of glass. It almost feels unnoticeable :)
Nope they're sticking with 845
"It really should be mandatory at this point to include these things, especially if we gotta pay 1000 bucks, but I'll take this with a smile. Thank you samsung "
Not if you need a 4000 mah battery to get by. Android needs to fix the software to prevent excessive wakelocks or whatever is causing the issues.
Another review doing to the fingerprint sensor wrong.
"Thing is, THE crucial bit of hardware that defines 50% of how good your audio is shouldn't cost $2 in the first place."
"Oh, if the dongle is passive then you're correct. Still, yay dongle. Yay charging != listening."
"not to discount Nokia/Light, but I think they could have most of what these 5 cameras do with only a monochrome/RGB pair. other lenses should have been for wide angle and zoom"
"Exactly, good software could achieve the image quality those other sensors are being used for. Not that it's taking a massive amount of space in the but it's space nonetheless and it coulda been utilized better. Aside from all that there are gonna be some interesting cases for this!"
GSMA: Event organizer of MWC + Huawei: Biggest sponsor of MWC = Best Phone Award: Mate 20 Pro
"Bit of a push to call it a screen protector - it looks like the same film that comes on every phone except without the air bubbles &amp; it has a hole cut out for the thumb reader, which will gather dirt around the edge"
"Not true anymore. The occasional weather app may not work, but there are hundreds of those. Even Google Maps and the Play Store work with microG. "
"Better to just give up and use software which data mines you for God knows who and what purpose? I don't think so, especially when there are alternatives. Also, Google Maps were just one example of popular software functioning without Google Play Services installed. There's of course OSMAnd and other solutions. "
"Don't hold your breath, the non pro redmi note 7 6/64 in China is selling for 255usd which is still higher than the 6/128 redmi note 7 pro price (240$) in India. If your country don't have Xiaomi store I am sure you will end up paying 300 usd upwards that for the phone and all the import bullshit"
Still waiting for Android pie...
"do you even know shit about Xiaomi phones? Mi 8, Mi A2, Mi A2 Lite, Redmi Note 5 pro all have US LTE bands even though they are not meant for US markets. .. open your mouth only when you know your stuff. "
"Not as always. Redmi Y2, 6 Pro, weren't good value phones. "
aaaaaand they don't work in the states. 
Whitestone Dome's are scams anyways.
"Why stop at a week's battery then? You'll say a week is enough, but actually a day's worth of battery ia fine. Slim phones are fine. Most people don't want bricks."
"Just got to have something to bitch about, right?  "
That's not true. You can't disable it.
Lmao have you ever used a pair of Bluetooth headphones? I have never once experienced lag when watching videos on any Bluetooth headphones I've used.
Just cut a hole in the screen protector where the thumb goes. Boom. 
"Doesn't sync passwords and it doesn't integrate into browsers on mobile, useless"
"You can disable it a handful of different ways, why would it matter how it's done?"
"A screen protector won't do anything to help prevent shattering during a fall.  The screens themselves are resistant to scratches.  I've never used a screen protector and never had a scratch on the screen.  My OG Droid had a freaking dent in it from being dropped, but the screen was flawless, even after 2 years."
"You shouldn't use Chrome but bitwarden for that, and stop with the Google wallgarden locked in inside one eco system mindset please, especially when he only asked about it bookmarks which this app covers. Thank you."
"Any decent phone company should include this. AND a silicone case for the phone. The first thing almost everyone does with a new phone is to go out and do this, it's nuts you have to do this yourself. Like buying a  ~~cat~~ car without a windscreen and a bonnet and then going to a difference vendor to get one fitted. To be honest, it's still amazing me how are not top of the range phones are made for toughness and endurance. Anything made to be tough is jenky and low quality as fuck when it comes to the actual software experience."
"If most of the reviewers are doing it wrong, may be, just may be, Samsung fucked up! "
Except it's the opposite. Being pro-Bixby is being against a monopoly (of google) while being anti-net neutrality is being for a monopoly.
"Well, having control over your device has nothing to do with monopolys. In your previous comment, you compared oranges with apples."
Where do you live that you need a flashlight that much? A cave?
Can you explain more?
Useless if you can't map it to Google assistant.
"As the person you're replying to said, they removed the ability through the native settings. You have to disable it via other means (ADB, bxActions, etc)"
"Nokia should have... focused, on longer battery life and greater durability. The world's slowest camera is just not going to grab a market share now that people are used to taking 10 or more pics in rapid succession and choosing the best one for posting. 10 seconds between pics is slower than an old Polaroid camera. "
"No, it doesn't. "
Do you get mad that you can't remap the cruise control button in your car? Lol
"Figured, I bet Google is getting that fine any day now lol. It's hilarious how hypocritical some people on here can be, not that I'm dissing Assistant or anything."
"I think the difference here is the button is a button, silly as that sounds... You can disable the squeeze and forget it exists, and it'll never get in your way. The button on the other hand, well. It's a button."
"If they allow it to be remapped, they cannot just arbitrarily block their competition. Same reason Google can't block their competitors on their search engine."
pixel 4 is going to beat this with a single camera
No it didn't
Why? It's a shitty plastic one. Why are you using your phone this way? Touching glass feels so much better! Why are you making your life so miserable on purpose? lol
The real question here is why are any articles from this trash site are allowed? 
I feel the same way about you!
"Accessibility services add another layer on top of whatever is available without it being enabled. This causes a delay surely. But how much depends on app/implementation. Although definitely not bad, I notice it whenever I decide to use it for a couple of days. Especially effects my scrolling performance. Not a huge difference though, I have picky eyes for framedrops "
"Thank fuck physical keyboards are coming back, I love my blackberry priv. However I don't like the idea of having to use the keyboard in landscape "
"I'm trying to be nice to you here, but again you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about. The competitors are still on the phone, Google Assistant, Alexa, ect whether or not you install them or they come preinstalled. They aren't limiting what assistant you use on your phone nor is it prejudice towards the consumer in any sense because other assistants are still usable on the phone. So no, it's not anti competitive no matter how much you repeat it. That is not and will never be considered limiting competition by any legal system."
Right on the money.
"I wonder how many people do complain about this as the feature is already available on Samsung and Mi phones which, joined together, overshadow stock Android based phones in sheer numbers. Oh and turns out it's also available on OxygenOS which is close to stock."
"Too little, too late. You're dead to me, Samsung. "
"... you are aware that Samsung manufactured the phone and the OS, right?"
You have to disable encryption in startup for BXActions.

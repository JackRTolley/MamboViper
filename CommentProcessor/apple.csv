The problem is apps dont need these features and you only have yourself to blame if you implement them  
NeitherThey dont even rank Apple is ranked higherJust because Elon Musk tweets it doesnt mean its true In fact If Elon is tweeting hes lying
Yeah because no one has ever said that before 
Thats a downgrade though wtf 
Lol its because apple is stupid for not supporting FREE vp not google Thank god they chose to support av this time around
Its been like this for months 
Its almost like capitalism isnt actually fucking sustainable 
Looks great my Wife would love that and call it cute and pretty 
Only fools would buy AirPods now New one is literally on the horizon 
All the low hanging fruit are gone Folding screens are just a another gimmick 
Hes right tho 
Its out of warranty what did you want a free phoneAlso the explosion lol Middle aged white woman are so dramatic
Based on all the comments here the screen is the only thing downgraded How could you even say that lol
Spark
And the iPad
NO Its spyware 
if its free youre the product not the customer but i get what you mean
gt I wish iCloud on Windows was betterFTFY
What is the problem with Organisation Its just automatically imported from your contact list which is usually synced with iCloudGoogle Contacts
Why am I not surprised Of course Microsoft cant make something that good
AKA I dont want to have to read the body of the post 
Jfc Are people paying that much for some ass sounding earbuds just cuz theyre wireless Literally  earbuds sounded better than my iPhone freebies
You really need to stop obsessing over that and move on 
I agree
VP is not standard tech its Google shoving their own codec on everyone 
Sure But I often see comments that mention competing brands being downvoted Regardless of the capacity they were mentioned in
Its not entirely stupid Theres no VP hardware decode in Intel chips Meaning it would require software decode which means higher CPU utilization and much less battery life
Seems greasy to charge a subscription for the app would rather just a onetime purchase like most apps
I love apple Big fan boyI still think foldable phones are stupid and a waste 
I doubt they could afford apple products 
Its so bad they stopped reporting the numbers I havent even seen an XRXS in the wild
Why not just straight ask what kind women do you prefer and which flavor of ice cream should you buyIts called personal preference for a reason
How is having a car and a plane all in one a gimmickHow is having an athletic shoe and roller skates all in one a gimmick Etc
For how many times can it fold to survive the average teenagers usage
Exactly apple could kill this app at any time and I wont be surprised if they do it
 Are you talking about Daesh
No when you rush to implement a feature thats not polished it gives you bad experience try Android if thats what you want
You dont need to be a dev to express that youre not a fan of something Iphone notifications have need nutoriously bad for ages
Might as well argue the closemaximizewindow buttons should be in the top right too
Theres a reason nobodys bought the Xr
Apple has the money to hire the programmers and engineers to make this a non issue 
Yeah no idea why this is being downvoted
gt And you wrote that you have to enter it all the timeI didnt but now im fully aware that reading comprehension isnt your strong suit
Savage 
LOL They are desperate for sales

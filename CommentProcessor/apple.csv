Yeah because no one has ever said that before ..
"Thats a downgrade though, wtf. "
So don't buy it. Something worth $1 to you might be worth $10 to me. There is no objective measure of worth. Devs have every right to target users who get the most value from their products.
Looks great my Wife would love that and call it cute and pretty 
Only fools would buy AirPods now. New one is literally on the horizon 
All the low hanging fruit are gone. Folding screens are just a another gimmick. 
I think the right scale here is more like $1-5 per ***year***. Consider that most paid apps are $1. Getting anyone to pay more than once is a 100% increase.
"Based on all the comments here, the screen is the only thing downgraded. How could you even say that lol"
"Spotify is only kind of different. Spotify Premium is like $600 over 5-years and you have nothing to show for it unless you plan to shell out $600+ for the next 5. Digital albums are like $5-7 now except for the brand new stuff. Even if you price up to $10, you're looking at owning 120 albums after 10-years for the same price and you can walk away still playing that music. It'll be another $1200+ for the next decade to continue the subscription."

And the iPad.
if it's free you're the product not the customer. but i get what you mean
"Yes, but looks otherwise, you're an iOS user and your friends and/or family is Android user. In this case you're forced to use 3rd party (Apple did it simple way, yes and it's great). But every single iOS user has those 3rd party apps installed as well for those specific cases. Only difference between people I know - is communication app of their choice (in Germany it was WhatsApp, in Russia it's Telegram, in god knows where it's Viber and so on)."
What is the problem with Organisation. It's just automatically imported from your contact list which is usually synced with iCloud/Google Contacts.
Why am I not surprised? Of course Microsoft can't make something that good.
Do airpods have noise cancelling? I don't think I'd ever spend that much for headphones without nc. Also do they sound any better than the classic Apple earbuds? For $140 they'd better sound nothing like them.
AKA I don't want to have to read the body of the post 
You really need to stop obsessing over that and move on... 
I agree
"Your comment being at -15 should tell you the state of this sub. Apple shifted from focusing on tech to marketing. Their marketing works, because there is a superiority complex with a significant percentage of iPhone owners and you can see it first-hand right here."
Sure. But I often see comments that mention competing brands being downvoted. Regardless of the capacity they were mentioned in.
"This sub is just filled with fanboys, stock owners and Apple employees (you'll keep seeing so many Apple sales guys in comments every now and then). This is so bizarre. I follow many product related subreddits and have never seen such jingoism, almost feels manufactured."
"It's not entirely stupid. There's no VP9 hardware decode in Intel chips. Meaning it would require software decode, which means higher CPU utilization and much less battery life."
Seems greasy to charge a subscription for the app; would rather just a one-time purchase like most apps.
I doubt they could afford apple products. 
It's so bad they stopped reporting the numbers. I haven't even seen an XR/XS in the wild.
"Because everything else is total shit in comparison. I don't want 10 different texting apps, I want one and everyone uses imessage and if they don't they're poor so I have no interest in talking to them."
"Exactly, apple could kill this app at any time and I won't be surprised if they do it."
? Are you talking about Daesh?
You don't need to be a dev to express that you're not a fan of something. Iphone notifications have need nutoriously bad for ages.
"Not sure what you're implying. iPhone was not the first smartphone. Windows Mobile existed before iOS, and touch screen phones existed years before the original iPhone. Apple just did it in a sexier, easier to use way and we all know how it played out afterwards."
Might as well argue the close/maximize/window buttons should be in the top right too.
There's a reason nobody's bought the Xr.
Apple has the money to hire the programmers and engineers to make this a non issue 
"Yeah, no idea why this is being downvoted."
Apple has the kind of money that will hire top-notch professionals to induce mind-blowing orgasms into the spouses and loved ones of the engineers that work tirelessly to make this technology a reality!
Savage 
LOL. They are desperate for sales.
NANI?!

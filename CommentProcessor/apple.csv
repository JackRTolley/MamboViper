The problem is apps don’t need these features and you only have yourself to blame if you implement them.  
"Neither.

They don't even rank. Apple is ranked higher.

Just because Elon Musk tweets it doesn't mean it's true. In fact... If Elon is tweeting, he's lying."
Yeah because no one has ever said that before ..
"Are you saying HomePod was the first in its category? HomePod was hardly the first smart speaker or internet-connected hifi speaker.

Or are you saying it is not ""better""? That's debatable, but it doesn't change the fact that Apple's strategy is to be later to market with a better product. Doesn't mean they always succeed, just that it's not surprising that they didn't rush a folding phone out.

"&gt;in the 6 months I have had the xr I haven’t had a single crash or hang up

I envy you... my XS Max deleted all 100GB of photos I had on the device and they refuse to download ever again from iCloud. The camera also just doesn't take photos sometimes... it won't work for a full day, any amount of restarting, shutting down, turning on, nothing works. Then, there are the times it takes a picture and nothing saves. 

Oh, and not to mention the insane amount of unoptimized apps that crash the phone daily... Facebook, Twitter, App Store, Apple Music, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, [Mail.app](https://Mail.app), Gmail, Inbox, ... "
"That’s not entirely true - the iPhone was certainly not the first smartphone - Palm, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, etc were already well established by then. I don’t know off of the top of my head but I’m also sure you could find several examples of full screen touch screen smartphones as well. While revolutionary, i don’t think there is a single one feature you could point to about the original iPhone and say that’s the “first” smartphone to have “that”. I think that’s what everyone gets wrong about the iPhone and Apple in general - Apple is not revolutionary in WHAT they deliver, they are revolutionary in HOW they deliver it. Apple’s products are greater than the sum of their parts. (That goes without saying, Apple has and does miss the mark sometimes, see comments on HomePod above)."
"Thats a downgrade though, wtf. "
So don't buy it. Something worth $1 to you might be worth $10 to me. There is no objective measure of worth. Devs have every right to target users who get the most value from their products.
Lol it’s because apple is stupid for not supporting FREE vp9 not google. Thank god they chose to support av1 this time around
It’s been like this for months 
It’s almost like capitalism isn’t actually fucking sustainable. 
Looks great my Wife would love that and call it cute and pretty

"Never understood the play for Apple in this already overcrowded space.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a dozen other ""own the home"" items that make more sense.  Smart clothes washer, dishwasher, maybe a smart oven??!?  Sure!  

&amp;#x200B;

But a car??  We already have Tesla - the Apple of Cars."
Only fools would buy AirPods now. New one is literally on the horizon 
All the low hanging fruit are gone. Folding screens are just a another gimmick. 
He’s right tho 
"Like I said, this has been a bizarre situation to me. I’ve personally never seen anything like this before. But that’s why I’m asking for input, so thank you. "
"It’s out of warranty, what did you want a free phone?

Also the “explosion” lol. Middle aged white woman are so dramatic."
I think the right scale here is more like $1-5 per ***year***. Consider that most paid apps are $1. Getting anyone to pay more than once is a 100% increase.
"Based on all the comments here, the screen is the only thing downgraded. How could you even say that lol"

Good for him that hes gotten the goals but people saying he is a world class striker If you like the guy then fair enough but dont kiss his ass cause he plays for us Support him and hope he does well for the club but dont chat rubbish Hes been dire for a while with the odd game that he does more than we expect but for the most part he doesnt do enough and needs to improve A world class striker that can barely control a football World class is thrown around way too much 
its  for a brand new starter kit
gtYou literally just said Stone was on the phone with Assange about the timing of the release why would they be on the phone about that if they already knew it was going to happenThat timeline just came out today during Cohens testimony  The article in the OP never gives any timelines  Cohen said the conversation took place July th or th  Thats the new information  If hed said the conversation took place way earlier like many speculated it would be a completely different storygtBut even if it wasnt the Russians it was still a criminal activity that a member of his campaign was involved with even if it was just communication about the material stolen in that crimeAgain the timeline is the difference  At best the information might corroborate what wikileaks was already telling everyone  There was no coordination  We still dont know who reached out to who  Maybe Assange just called Stone up to let him know Cohens testimony doesnt clarifygtYeah hes uniquely deplorable for not reporting this fact you dont think the FBI would have wanted to know that a member of your campaign was communicating with an organization that was receiving information stolen in a Russian espionage operation Maybe theyd want to know but heres the thing I dont believe that  of politicians would do any differently than Trump did  If you believe Cohen they werent involved in any of it  They didnt know it was stolen emails because they didnt know what wikileaks was going to release They got an incredibly vague heads up from an unreliable source a few days in advance that something vague was going to be bad for their opponent

gt This is about protecting women in a patriarchal society Sure if you just make up whatever wacky explanation that fits into your worldview you want you can read anything in the Biblegt Ok but lets look at the fathers of the faith who had concubines and multiple wives David was called a man after Gods own heart  Is this a version of Christianity where it was started by flawless people we should look up to and emulate instead of Godgt Homosexuality in Roman culture was about excess and exerting control over another human Sexuality wasnt defined as gay or straight It was dominant and submissive And for a man to be submissive was demoralizing And so rich ppl would take what they wanted from who they wanted as a show and abuse of powerWere Romans another species Why were they so radically different  entirely lacking the drives which people today claim means gay people must be protected so their urges can be acted on  that Pauls teachings in the New Testament cant be applied to all people but just Romans and are essentially just historical space fillerIn short these explanations are ad hoc and leave the Bible in tatters and subject to a new standard where any passage can be twisted through a rationalization to say whatever you want They makes yourself your ultimate authority instead of God

More ChapoTrapHouse bullshit on this sub AOC and Bernie Sanders are the antithesis of nuanced though I will agree that they are well intentioned Stubborn ignorant people like AOC and Sanders are socialist sledgehammers in search of a nail to swing at Their cult following is even more dangerously ignorant than they are For instance you are ignoring all of the polls that show a drastic drop in public support for these policies when specifics like huge taxes and not driving or eating meat are introduced So much for nuance I guessLay off of the Chapo and Adderall its a bad combo

 Really I mean  reallyToplevel responses represent feminist ideas As a sub we are concerned that they represent feminism accurately Many most of our regular posters are radical feminists as the term is properly understood but they are not sexist against men do not think that transgender people ought to stay locked into the sex they are assigned at birth and do not look down on women who choose traditional gender roles That is simply untrue and to allow a post that claims that radical feminists behave in which ways they dont to remain at the toplevel as if it were a true representation of feminist ideas is just  wrongMy comment to you is the same cutandpaste that I provide to everyone who makes a toplevel comment that isnt aligned with our sub rules and in this case I added the extra bit to explain why It is absolutely unreasonable for you to get huffy when you were the one who didnt know what they were talking about as everyone here has explained to you

In this case you will have to deviate from the default news subreddits as any conservative opinions is typically censored through downvotes Youre incredibly unwelcome on any default news subreddit as someone who is right of center politically instead of left of center There is really no point in even expressing your opinion as you wont get anything out of itThis default news subreddits dont really care about discussions which is why this entire comment section is just one large circlejerk The comments that actually go against the narrative of the subreddit are downvoted instead of upvoted for providing grounds for an actual discussion like youre supposed to doThis is also highlighted by the fact that this subreddit is supposed to be about world news but all of the news that actually hit the frontpage is just about bashing Trump

Thanks for the link mate  It states in the article he changed his statement about how the robes were able to be moved to enable the alleged act to occur that seems like a key point  I guess I would say to believe a witness to the point above what is likely to have occurred to this is certain to have occurred would require knowledge or description of something that they couldnt possibly know without the event occurring something like a mole on Pells rude bits or something  I have read elsewhere that he was able to describe the room it occurred to detail this is quite crucial because  one would think to remember a room he wasnt permitted to be in would indicate something traumatic must have occurred in that room to remember it after so many yearsSo much about the case just doesnt make sense though why would an intelligent man like Pell take such risk in a room that he was very unfamiliar with due to it being only his st or nd sermon there  Why would he take such a risk with  kids he wasnt acquainted with  And why  kids that is full of risk when we know that generally in these instances priests groom a child for an extended period of time before such hideous acts I want to reiterate that Im not saying Pell is innocent just that I question the beyond reasonable doubt

Its completely unrealistic to not expect people to maximise profitsCalling them names is ridiculousIf you want to influence prices you need to do it through market forces supply and demand or with lawsDecreasing the number of people or increasing supply of rental properties will cause property prices to decrease eg what happened in ChristchurchIncreasing demand by increasing immigration or encouraging people to move to a specific region eg Auckland or Wellington will cause prices to rise dramaticallyCalling people selfish and expecting them to lose    per week is not going to achieve anything except make people think less of your position

The irony of this is that Id wager youre one of those guys who bitches about the decline of Western CivilizationCollege exists to transmit the knowledge of Western Civilization to the next generationLook up the history of the University Theres a reason people are a Doctor of PhilosophyAlso ironically Id wager youre the type of guy who bitches about useless Humanities degrees Again those exist to transmit the knowledge of Western Civilization  This is why Classics exists Take a Literature course Its going to be a whole lot of boring books from some boring European guys Ditto for Art HistorySure modern universities have expanded and you can learn about other cultures too But the core of the Humanities in Western Universities are really the only places left in our culture where people study celebrate and pass on the fundamental texts that form the basis of Western CivilizationI often find that the more someone criticizes collegeuniversity the more likely it is that theyve never actually taken any classes at oneThe idea that universities are Marxist indoctrination camps is laughable in the reality that they produce the entirety of the Capitalist ruling class and their army of bureaucrats and administrators

Hi again Maggie Im back and Ive been doing more thoughtsI only recently heard the last couple Crime Writers On podcasts and in the latest one they make a point to give a shoutout to you for toughing it out in the long run of the MM world in the face of the reaction they got last week just for having you on their show As a result of it those same sources of discontent on Twitter despite having no direct accuser have reacted very badly for perceiving that theyre being called out on their endless tiresome stIn light of this my question to you would be  do you understand irony and are you able to give any good examples

I dont want to come off as confrontative but the time when we actually needed help was in getting it to be a working product Luckily people were willing to offer their time to get it to that point when the original call for devs went out despite the mess of a lead we had at the timeAnd wow is that link about as irrelevant to the topic as could be yes of course we are aware how to remove files from a folder Were actually doing the proper thing instead and going through our entire codebase to find any other places that look like they couldve been based from SKSE at some point It is a seven year old project after all such things are bound to have happened at one point or another
I finished my collection of pedals that I have been wanting  I have played with them all so far except for the mxr reverb So if you have any questions ask away I do not have a favorite as they all have something different and unique going for them My only  annoyances so far are that the leds on mxr pedals could blind you and eventide uses center positive power supplies They all work great with synths well not sure about the mxr reverb but it should My behringer vd is already on the way for a replacement and is the only one not shown It started to distort and stopped working after about  hours of use I guess this is not super uncommon on that one

For large businesses they wont be as affected because they have the capital Even then look like companies like Amazon who increased their minimum wages to  but decreased employees benefits as a result What about small businesses Are you assuming that small businesses are balling in money and have tonnes of capital to match up with these larger companies Invariably these small businesses and companies will be the most affected by a minimum wage increase even when before they were more than capable of earning a decent profit At that point the increase in wages will eat into their profits so much that they either choose to raise product prices sack employees or close for good

I guess it all comes down to personal preference As an example is the practice of preordering good As a theory it is however the way it is used nowadays its complete garbage but people still do it Im against it because it lets developers get away with releasing unfinished games but fanboys have a different opinion I dont like where the industry s going and the side CCP is taking but I cant do anything myself and since there are enough people happy with the way things are all I can do is voice my opinion here

So Drop play is not as prevalent which is factually correct  again on ladder and at the pro level because it is not as effective as Raven backed pushes which is also factually correct hence why they are far more prevalent than they used to be is not a valid argument The pros have to play multiple games in a row against the same opponent You cant MarineTankRaven push EVERY game Play like Maru is a meme because Maru has ridiculous micro No one can play like Maru  even other pros cant match his ability to get the absolute most value out of every single unit Balancing the game around Maru and basing your arguments around his accomplishments is pretty unconvincingAlso name calling is not becoming You dont have to get all pissy because everyone else in the thread is disagreeing with you Youre peeing into the wind and getting mad at the wind I stopped mine drops and lib harass because the Raven backed pushes are so much more effective AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE GAMENo one said that you have to kill  million probes and win the game with just harass Harass is supposed to put the Terran ahead if successfully done  the rate at which harass is successful is very low Hence why players are not using it as often as they used to Its pretty straight forward A big push into macro with harass as a means of distraction is far better than opening with harass Getting your drop killed right off the bat without doing any damage is basically an auto loss nowadaysampxBEDIT  I wanted to clarify as I think we might not be on the same page I stopped using widow mine drops and liberator harass AS OPENERS They are still highly effective later on in the game as an additional prong to your main attack Maxiliciouss point about Ravens coming from starports implies utilizing the starport for harass as part of your opening build You have to drop etc later on in the game to get the opponent to get distractedmove their army out of position

gtYou literally just said Stone was on the phone with Assange about the timing of the release why would they be on the phone about that if they already knew it was going to happenThat timeline just came out today during Cohens testimony  The article in the OP never gives any timelines  Cohen said the conversation took place July th or th  Thats the new information  If hed said the conversation took place way earlier like many speculated it would be a completely different storygtBut even if it wasnt the Russians it was still a criminal activity that a member of his campaign was involved with even if it was just communication about the material stolen in that crimeAgain the timeline is the difference  At best the information might corroborate what wikileaks was already telling everyone  There was no coordination  We still dont know who reached out to who  Maybe Assange just called Stone up to let him know Cohens testimony doesnt clarifygtYeah hes uniquely deplorable for not reporting this fact you dont think the FBI would have wanted to know that a member of your campaign was communicating with an organization that was receiving information stolen in a Russian espionage operation Maybe theyd want to know but heres the thing I dont believe that  of politicians would do any differently than Trump did  If you believe Cohen they werent involved in any of it  They didnt know it was stolen emails because they didnt know what wikileaks was going to release They got an incredibly vague heads up from an unreliable source a few days in advance that something vague was going to be bad for their opponent

gt This is about protecting women in a patriarchal society Sure if you just make up whatever wacky explanation that fits into your worldview you want you can read anything in the Biblegt Ok but lets look at the fathers of the faith who had concubines and multiple wives David was called a man after Gods own heart  Is this a version of Christianity where it was started by flawless people we should look up to and emulate instead of Godgt Homosexuality in Roman culture was about excess and exerting control over another human Sexuality wasnt defined as gay or straight It was dominant and submissive And for a man to be submissive was demoralizing And so rich ppl would take what they wanted from who they wanted as a show and abuse of powerWere Romans another species Why were they so radically different  entirely lacking the drives which people today claim means gay people must be protected so their urges can be acted on  that Pauls teachings in the New Testament cant be applied to all people but just Romans and are essentially just historical space fillerIn short these explanations are ad hoc and leave the Bible in tatters and subject to a new standard where any passage can be twisted through a rationalization to say whatever you want They makes yourself your ultimate authority instead of God

People keep expecting it to pump but even pump amp dump groups wont pump a coin that is past the speculative phase and onto the deliver or die phase The jig is upThat said I still wouldnt be surprised to see it pump like crazy if and when their mainnet launch is successful I swapped my remaining WTC for BAT the other day and rode the pump up to  For now Ive switched all of it to ICX Hopefully my BAT profits give me some wiggle room in case WTC does rise soon Victor Cobra

Thats such a whack line of thinking He didnt have to do anything and he certainly didnt do anything to appease people randoms on Reddit He endorsed Hillary because they share a lot of policy in common I dont think its reflective of all Bernie supporters but the fact that some of you despise Hillary so much still isnt doing you any favors in winning over primary supporters Shes not running idk what some Bernie supporters fixiation on her is

Frost didnt turn around the Golden Knights of Central Florida The Golden Knights of Central Florida went  and won the Fiesta Bowl in  and went  in  They were winless in  because George OLeary literally stopped coaching the team and got fired midseason The talent was always there they just needed a coach who would actually show up for workSo try again

Satirical comment is now somehow a rational refutation Get bent dudeEdit Its exaggerated but is still logically consistent Since you want to go try hard grandstander you in the end are mad at OP because he doesnt enjoy gay sex and finds it repulsive Youre not calling him homophobic because he actually treats gay people wrongly or anything of that nature youre mad because hes not gay So my example was intentionally exaggerated and Satirical but yet it follows the same train of logic youre using except I followed it to its conclusion so like I said get bent 
More ChapoTrapHouse bullshit on this sub AOC and Bernie Sanders are the antithesis of nuanced though I will agree that they are well intentioned Stubborn ignorant people like AOC and Sanders are socialist sledgehammers in search of a nail to swing at Their cult following is even more dangerously ignorant than they are For instance you are ignoring all of the polls that show a drastic drop in public support for these policies when specifics like huge taxes and not driving or eating meat are introduced So much for nuance I guessLay off of the Chapo and Adderall its a bad combo 
Thanks Id like to see you submit better or anything for that matter An article a meme you reposted an original anythingItll hit the front page of the subreddit That is a promise

When I said it I had no idea it was even offensive Thats part of the problem An extremely small minority decides something offends them and expects everyone to conform to what they think It will never make sense to me that adding a y to a word makes it hate speech 
Uh no Did you read the entire thing Hes not in trouble for the rocket Hes in trouble cause he threw it out of his car and sped off like he was trying to get out of the blast radius Thats beyond stupid for like anythingIf he threw a backpack out the car window unannounced and sped off it would have likely garnered the same response 
Yes I was expecting the same GIF but this one is different Weeee
 Really I mean  reallyToplevel responses represent feminist ideas As a sub we are concerned that they represent feminism accurately Many most of our regular posters are radical feminists as the term is properly understood but they are not sexist against men do not think that transgender people ought to stay locked into the sex they are assigned at birth and do not look down on women who choose traditional gender roles That is simply untrue and to allow a post that claims that radical feminists behave in which ways they dont to remain at the toplevel as if it were a true representation of feminist ideas is just  wrongMy comment to you is the same cutandpaste that I provide to everyone who makes a toplevel comment that isnt aligned with our sub rules and in this case I added the extra bit to explain why It is absolutely unreasonable for you to get huffy when you were the one who didnt know what they were talking about as everyone here has explained to you
Crap
Misogynist is questionable but that headline is  accurate otherwise Hes acting like a little cunt

In this case you will have to deviate from the default news subreddits as any conservative opinions is typically censored through downvotes Youre incredibly unwelcome on any default news subreddit as someone who is right of center politically instead of left of center There is really no point in even expressing your opinion as you wont get anything out of itThis default news subreddits dont really care about discussions which is why this entire comment section is just one large circlejerk The comments that actually go against the narrative of the subreddit are downvoted instead of upvoted for providing grounds for an actual discussion like youre supposed to doThis is also highlighted by the fact that this subreddit is supposed to be about world news but all of the news that actually hit the frontpage is just about bashing Trump

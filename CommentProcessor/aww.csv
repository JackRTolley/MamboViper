"True. But based on the trailers, comments by those working on the film, casting and past movies with this type of press, it smells like crap. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure we have another Ant Man 2 like turd sandwich coming. "
If I'm wrong I'll admit it. 
The trailers are not doing it favors nor is the main actor. 
Or just made a Black Widow movie.  Brie Larsen is one of the most pretentious and smug people I have ever seen elevated by activists on the left. 
These furries are getting bold.

"Ah, so refreshing to see the hypocritical sexists of reddit making... a sexist generalization"
Considering rotten tomatoes had to change the entire format of their website to cover up the abysmal failure of this movie should prove you wrong.

You gotta stop using SJW unironically. It's just cringe at this point.

Poor cat has to watch CNN. It explains the expression.
"Captain Marvel will be a big commercial success, exactly like any other big movies. Incels couldn't stop the female ghostbuster from grossing 230 millions and they certainly can't stop an MCU movie from making a ton of money either. Stop being delusional."
"It's predictable, boring, lazy, written to the lowest common denominator. The movie is also forgettable. One of the worst Marvel has made. "
Maybe..!
"You can't? When see the trailer for let's say Madea, you can't tell it's dog shit? Same goes for Aladdin or anything Sandler"
Seems quite happy about the whole situation
Are you seriously comparing a wild animal to a dictator?
"Sexist is a word with an actual meaning, you know. It's not just a word that makes you feel bad so you can turn it around and use it on others to make them feel bad. Also, your little echo chamber of emotionally fragile review bombers is not really powerful enough to make an MCU movie bomb."

Smart thinking bluring out the name tag. Wouldn't want your cat to get bullied on social media or get harassing calls at work.
"Asian humor is so amazing! I have never laughed so much in my whole life! so real, so natural!"

Does it take AAs or AAAs?
"Twitter and youtube is full of brigading assholes who want to tear down this movie because... er... they don't like Brie I guess. Trust me dude, I think you're a little biased in this matter."
"The fact that this is downvoted is kinda the issue here. People should realize that there will be people who *are* hating on this film for that reason alone (excluding those who express actual reasons regarding what Brie said or w/e) ... but instead they downvote you because they think you are ... what, generalizing them?"
This is the cutest thing I have ever fucking seen
r/BossFight
In the comics hell no they aren't their artist and writing talent has gone massively downhill.  Movies we will see what happens after they retire the current A listers but if their pick for Captain Marvel is indicative of the direction their casting will be taking that's uh not good.

How can she slap?!
Is she the super hero who wants to destroy all white men?
So cute it looks like a stuffed animal.
It's literally only because if the movie bud. It being top selling this month doesn't change how terrible it has been doing forever.

It's going to be a hit because it's another female hero. All the ding dongs like you are going to ignore and criticisms and deem them sexist. 
When will you be cutting the ears off those puppies? 
What a cute emotional support animal
Brie Larson hates white males
I LOVE THIS 
Look me a second to realize the puppies lol
I didn't like her when she was cast in this role but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Now I'm skipping out on this film because of her racist comments.
What does skin color have to do with this?
Cute kid. The racists piece of anti male trash with the pen should learn to code....
Congrats on getting more downvotes than my original comment. What a ride! 
"Oh, you think I actually read all of that? That's cute. "
When did getting Oscar winners to be cast in movies become a bad thing? 
"As a man, anytime you can keep anything of value in a divorce, you are a winner. "
"Seriously, like a 12 year old made the title."
Aha! Finally a rational commenter that talks about the real heart of the issue. Just try not to cast your pearls before swine too often. This is Reddit after all.

"... and I'd bet the inclusion rider doesn't have anything about requiring men to be 50% of the jobs where they're underrepresented, like wardrobe, hair, and makeup."
Except cringe is a word in the English vocabulary and isn't only used by immature bandwagoners 
It might as well be called oscar bait the movie
Good for her!  She looks so excited!  Well she should be.  Captain Marvel was made for girls only after all.
While this looks incredibly staged and I'm not a big fan of brie Larson mainly because I haven't seen her in anything so I don't know much about her . Its still nice that a little child got to walk the red carpet and meet her idol. Also can't wait to see Gemma in this I hope we get even more opportunities like this for Asian actors in film and tv

"According to what? It's the people at marvel who decides who's how strong and not, surely they are in charge of that. If they decide they want to make her the most powerful in these movies, then she is. "
She had the audacity to point out that most critics are older white males and that she'd like to see that evolve in the future. 
"But OP did help. It went on for a while for sure, but OP lifted the cat out of the pack and put it on the step."
Oh my god. So cute.
Oh good Lord. This is adorable!
Why didn't she do that for wonder woman. Which didn't force this girl power stuff 
"Axactly. It seems the Cat is happy for the love, but bored for their act..!"
This is so filtered and pixelated that I legit have no clue if it even started out as a photo.

I have 2 girls and their girl power beats most man power.
"Ahh let them. I just wish they'd talk to me, tell me what they think is wrong about the opinion. It's the big problem I have with reddit's downvote system.

"Good argument for a crate/kennel. Wire ones are good, but I'd probably get one of the airline ones used to ship dogs, because I'd assume your dog would figure out how to slip the tray out of a wire one and the walk around the house in it. Good luck! Everytime I think to myself that I want a puppy, I remember how much work they are, and how lucky I am that my girls are ten and sleep literally all day. "

It's pretty normal to leave a dog without food or water while youre not home during the day. If it has water it will have an accident. And why TF would you leave food? Dogs only eat twice a day.
